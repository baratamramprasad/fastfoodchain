# fastfoodchain problem

## Problem Statement
 - A large fast food chain wants you to generate forecast for 2000 restaurants of this fast food chain. Each restaurant has close to 500 items that they sell.The fast food chain provides data for last 3 years at a store, item, day level. The ask is provide forecast out for the following year.
Assume the data is static. Data Scientist look at the problem and have figured out a solution that provides the best forecast.
The data scientist have built an algorithm that takes all data at a store level and produce forecasted output at the store level.
It takes them 15 minutes to process each store.

- Questions:
    1) Given the input data is static. What is the right technology to store the data and what would be the partitioning strategy?
    2) Each store takes 15 minutes, how would you design the system to orchestrate the compute faster - so the entire compute can finish this in < 5hrs
   Make any assumptions in your way and state them as you design the solution and do not worry about the analytic part. Assume the analytic
part is a black box.
